                        Alcor is a coguar-dragon hybrid with telekinetic powers who lives in [REDACTED] City in the year 2601. In this time period, the world has solved most of its problems, and most settlements effortlessly combine
                        high-tech amenities with abundant natural landscapes. While this means that most places are peaceful and wonderful places to live, [REDACTED] City offers thrilling adventures for risk-takers who want to hone their
                        fighting skills. The city experiences sporadic kaiju attacks, has an active underground street brawling culture, and has a highly traversable layout for parkour enthusiasts.

Castor's body is made up of exotic matter, which powers a large chunk of Alcor's inventions. This means that while Alcor can fabricate a lot of interesting gadgets, there's a giant waitlist for his commissions. On top of that, Alcor has his own personal projects he is working on, while collaborating he has with other inventors and superheroes in the city, making his waitlist even longer."}

This increases the percentage of exotic matter in Alcor's body, allowing Castor to mold Alcor's body into an evolved form personalized for Castor, dubbed Sentinel Mode. In Sentinel Mode, Castor is able to fire globs of exotic matter that quickly binds hostile entities on contact. In addition, his sensory abilities are enhanced, allowing for better detection of potential threats. Castor can also assume this form for short periods of time outside of combat, but without any of the defensive capabilities. This limitation leaves Castor disheartened, as he yearns for liberation from his role as the lab's mascot, aspiring instead for him permanently having his imposing physical form."
