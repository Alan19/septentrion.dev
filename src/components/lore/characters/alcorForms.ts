He frequently used this form when participating in athletic activities during college such as swimming and sparring. The placement of the shell daggers make it impractical to wear long sleeved clothing, so Alcor refrains from using this form on land in colder climates. This is slightly remedied by Alcor's custom tailored wetsuit for this form, which allows for slightly higher temperature tolerance by being able to cover more of his body without interfering with his shell daggers.",

Its shark tail provides higher swim speed compared to a normal Samurott while it's buoyant tail orb allows for enhanced vertical speed in water, allowing for unusual aquatic maneuvers.",

Alcor equipped this form with light berserker armor, as well as energy claws and a double edged spear, both of which are charged with electricity. By default, attempting to integrate Zinogre traits into a body requires tricky balancing of natural armor, ease of use, and flexibility, but by integrating Zeraora traits, Alcor was able to optimize all 3 parameters to a state that he was comfortable with.\n",

However, he is looking into possible enhancements to this form to make it more battle ready instead. He is slightly nervous about using this form during the daytime, often opting to use it at night for parkour or patrolling.

Its body also contains various tendrils composed of biomechanical mind-machine interfaces that allow him to interface and hack into machinery. These tendrils can be extended and retracted at will, but usually curl around his limbs by default. The form also sports a pair of clawed gauntlets that drastically enhances the force of its punches, while its claws can slice through light armor with ease. It also sports Castor's signature phantasmal butterfly wing augment, allowing for complex midair maneuvers.",

This form features a much stronger tail with two rows of spikes with much higher spike density, along with a muscle system that is optimized for physical strength without losing dexterity.

By having Castor slowly infuse his cells from the inside of his body, he can effectively stay recognizable while showing off the changes to his body. He also is impressed by the enhanced tail, hair, and horns on his body, giving him a more confident demeanor when he's in this form. As a result, Alcor usually wears a tank top and shorts in this form, allowing him to show off his enhanced body better. He often uses this form when he needs to do anything that requires extra strength or endurance, or when showing off.",

The bone and metal plating are influenced by Midnight Lycanroc and various steel type Pokemon, which greatly increases his defense. Alcor has a much wilder personality in this form, and acts slightly uninhibited as a result. Alcor is greatly impressed by how it combines the power of both Gemini and AICore without having much drawbacks.",

It sports a more dragonic snout and horns, as well as bone and metal plating on its body. The energy wings have also changed into a slightly more dragonic shape. The exotic matter circulation has also been changed to be managed through his horns, causing its eyes to glow blue. Its physical strength and size is much higher in this form, due to this form's having higher parameters in managing exotic matter. This form specializes in short and mid range defense. It sports three tails, which are even further enhanced compared to his Gemini Form, with higher length and much sharper spikes that are designed to impale targets. Each tail also powers three drones each, which can fire lasers are distant targets to make it harder for them to approach. It also uses a pair of exotic matter clawed gauntlets to fight in close range.",

        body: "This hero suit sports a labcoat to give off the vibe of a doctor or scientist. This is contrasted with a pitch black bodysuit with glowing green lines of exotic matter running to it hooked up to tanks of exotic matter to pump more exotic matter into Alcor's body to enhance it at a moment's notice. With his face mostly consumed by his symbiote, it gives him the perfect mad scientist vibe. His primary weapon is his dart gun, which is loaded with programmable symbiote matter, allowing him to use it to inject healing, paralytic, or mutagenic substances into others. Those who are injected with the symbiote mutagen tend to regenerate from their injuries at a rapid rate, while mutating into symbiote monsters that express their personality and fighting styles in 'a new light'. His claws and tail spikes are also tipped with the same symbiote matter, allowing him to administer it in close range as well. As combat intensifies, or when he needs more physical strength, his suit can rapidly pump more exotic matter into his body, augmenting his physical strength and physique, without forcing him to evolve when his body reaches the various thresholds for exotic matter. This minimizes the risk of wardrobe malfunctions, but he can manually override this restriction when he wants to look more intimidating.",
        history: `Alcor developed the Biogenesis suit when he and Castor were thinking of a way to express their identity as AICore while performing superhero duties. Due to ethical concerns, he only administers healing and paralytic substances, and only gives mutagens to people who have already consented to accepting the mutagen, or in life or death situations. His mutagenic abilities sometimes causes him to make a scene by impaling his allies on his claws, and then seeing the expression on onlookers' faces as his allies rapidly recover from their injuries and possibly transform into what looks like a video game boss' second health bar. The transformation is temporary, but people who are interested in their monstrous forms are invited to come to Alcor's lab for checkups and consultations on how to fully customize their symbiote monster forms. Alcor is delighted to help others bring out their 'inner monster' and loves showing his evolved forms to others, but the number of volunteers has stayed in the single digits, mainly limited to his close friends. A lesser known fact is that this suit draws some inspiration from a superhero suit Alcor once designed and modeled in that is reminiscent of a war general from the far east. That suit is now manufactured as standard issue for another city's defense force against Kaiju attacks, but Alcor's original design also came with some extra accessories that was removed as it looks out of place when it is something designed to be worn by large groups of people.`
