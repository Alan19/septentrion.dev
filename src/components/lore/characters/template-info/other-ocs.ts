        history: "Soma's primary weapons are a dueling sword and a dart pistol that is usually loaded with darts that contain poisons and explosives. He is quite charming and agile on the battlefield, allowing him to dart around and attack from unexpected angles. In more deadly situations, he also has a nano blade that can inflict heavy damage to highly durable enemies. As he is from a space age civilization, he wears a space-age spacesuit which functions as high quality PPE, but in a more physical fight, his spacesuit has a harness that can project hardlight plate armor around his body. He is a big sentai and sci-fi fan, so he likes to fight like a sentai character, complete with an anime transformation sequence.",

        body: "Soma is a character for a custom TTRPG setting with a class-less character building system, but his fighting style is closest to that of a bard and a swashbuckler. As a son to a married couple of explorers, he was involved in an accident when he was traveling with his parents that caused his brain to upgraded to an artificial brain constructed from exotic materials from another world. When he woke up, he found himself with a small robotic wyvern that his parents later realized was a Familiar for casting spells. Because of his brain replacement, his parents, who are from a traditional fantasy forested city had to send him to live with relatives in a nearby settlement that has more experts in futuristic / space age technology, which would be able to provide better support and services for his new brain. His upgraded brain allows him to better manage his mental state and also allows him to interface with computers remotely. Shortly after his 19th birthday, while he was on a shopping trip in his old hometown, he got swept up in the initiation trials for the newly reopened Adventurer's Society. He passed, allowing him to be initiated as an adventurer, and proceeded to set off with others who took the trial with him on a journey to resolve festering complications in his homeland and beyond.",
